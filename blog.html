    <h2>BMW Begins Road Testing of Solid State Battery in i7</h2>
    <P>by AKSHAY BABU T K . 23/05/2025</P>
    <p>Group has begun road-testing all-solid-state battery (ASSB) cells in a BMW i7 prototype, marking a significant step in the brand’s push toward next-gen EV tech. The trials are currently underway near Munich, where large-format ASSB cells from U.S.-based battery innovator Solid Power are being evaluated.
        Unlike conventional lithium-ion setups, ASSB technology promises higher energy density, longer range, and reduced weight, thanks to its compact design and use of solid electrolytes. The i7 test vehicle combines BMW’s Gen5 battery architecture with new modules optimized to handle the unique characteristics of solid-state cells — including pressure management and thermal behavior.

The cells, developed and manufactured by Solid Power in close collaboration with BMW engineers, use sulfide-based electrolytes. Their full integration into the i7 will yield critical data on real-world performance, helping shape BMW’s future battery strategy.
his partnership builds on a tech transfer agreement signed in 2022. BMW will also run its own prototype solid-state cell line at its Cell Manufacturing Competence Center (CMCC) in Parsdorf using Solid Power’s know-how.

        <H2>Indian Motorcycles: America's First Motorcycle</H2>
        <p class="www" >by AKSHAY BABU T K . 23/05/2025</p>
        <p class="www">When you think of iconic American motorcycle brands, names like Harley-Davidson often come to mind. But long before Harley became a household name, there was another pioneer that blazed a trail in the motorcycle world: Indian Motorcycles. Founded in 1901, Indian Motorcycles holds the title of America’s first motorcycle manufacturer and has a rich history that is deeply intertwined with the evolution of the motorcycle industry.
            

The Birth of a Legend
Indian Motorcycles was established by George M. Hendee and Oscar Hedstrom in Springfield, Massachusetts. The duo initially focused on producing bicycles, but their passion for innovation led them to experiment with motorized bikes. Their breakthrough came in 1901 when they built their first prototype—a single-cylinder, 1.75 horsepower bike that they proudly dubbed the "Indian." The name was a nod to the brand's American heritage and the Native American imagery that would become synonymous with the brand.

Early Success and Innovation <hr> <img class="uuu" src="image copy 2.png" width="400" alt=""><hr>

Indian Motorcycles quickly gained a reputation for quality and performance. In 1903, Indian introduced its first production model, the "Indian Single," which featured a 2.5 horsepower engine and a belt drive. This model set the stage for future innovations and established Indian as a leading player in the motorcycle industry.

One of Indian's notable achievements in the early years was its success in racing. Indian bikes dominated the racing circuit, with the brand winning its first race in 1901 and continuing to win numerous races throughout the 1910s and 1920s. Indian's dedication to performance and reliability was evident, and its bikes became a favorite among riders and racers alike.</p>
